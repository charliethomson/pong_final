<h1> Pong </h1>
<p>This is a pong game made using pyglet and the python standard library. I made it over the span of about ten days. Every file in this repo was written either by me or by the program itself (saves). I'm currently reformatting the entire thing (26 Oct), because the code is <strong>GOD AWFUL</strong>. Loading was the most pointlessly difficult thing to do, but I got it to work so we coo. </p>

<h2>To run:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>have pyglet installed</li>
	<li>type python3 main.py</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.twitter.com/hashtag/ezpz">#ezpz</a></li>
</ul>
